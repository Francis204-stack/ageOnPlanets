# Space Age Calculator in C++

This program calculates how old a person would be on each planet in our Solar System based on their age in seconds.


## What It Does

- You input your age in **seconds**
- The program converts it into **Earth years**
- Then it calculates your age on:
  - Mercury
  - Venus
  - Earth
  - Mars
  - Jupiter
  - Saturn
  - Uranus
  - Neptune

It uses each planet's orbital period (in Earth years) to determine your equivalent age.


## Orbital Periods Used

| Planet   | Orbital Period (Earth Years)  |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Mercury  | 0.2408467                     |
| Venus    | 0.61519726                    |
